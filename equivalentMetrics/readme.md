# Equivalent Metrics

## Overview
These codes turn war-related CO‚ÇÇ results from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations into intuitive equivalences:

- **Trees** needed to offset emissions (annual mature-tree sequestration).  
- **Smartphones** manufactured with the same CO‚ÇÇ footprint.  
- **Car-year equivalents** (number of average cars driving for a year).  

The three R scripts read precomputed CSVs, aggregate by scenario, apply published benchmarks, and export poster-ready bar charts.

---

## Dependencies
All scripts use base R plus:

- `ggplot2` (plotting)  
- `dplyr` (aggregation)  
- `scales` (axis/label formatting; used in phone & car plots)  

---

## Data Inputs
- **`outputs/mc_totals_draws.csv`**  
  Per-draw totals of war-related CO‚ÇÇ (kg), with at least:  
  `scenario`, `total` (kg CO‚ÇÇ per draw).

- **`outputs/mc_summary_by_day.csv`**  
  Daily median emissions (kg), with at least:  
  `scenario`, `med` (median kg CO‚ÇÇ per day).

- **`outputs/marginal_per_vehicle_mc.csv`**  
  Scenario totals for marginal per-vehicle emissions, with at least:  
  `scenario`, `per_vehicle_total_kg_med` (kg).

**Units note:** all inputs are **kg CO‚ÇÇ**. Scripts convert to tonnes or unit counts as needed.

## What Each Script Does

### 1) `MC_total_draws.R`
**Question:** How many trees are needed to offset the emission?  

**Goal:** Show how many mature trees (per year) are needed to offset the war-related emissions.  

**Steps**
1. Read `outputs/mc_totals_draws.csv`.  
2. Aggregate by scenario: `mean(total)` ‚Üí average kg CO‚ÇÇ.  
3. Divide by kg absorbed per mature tree per year.  
4. Plot number of trees by scenario and save `plots/trees_equivalent.png`.  

**Key Assumption / Constant**
- `kg_per_tree = 21 kg CO‚ÇÇ` absorbed per mature tree per year (USDA global averages).  

**Reference**  
USDA / Arbor Day Foundation estimates show a mature tree absorbs about 48 lb CO‚ÇÇ/year (~22 kg/year).

### 2) `MC_summary_by_day.R`
**Question:** How many smartphones can be manufactured with the same CO‚ÇÇ emission?  

**Goal:** Express scenario totals as the number of smartphones whose manufacturing emits the same CO‚ÇÇ.  

**Steps**
1. Read `outputs/mc_summary_by_day.csv`.  
2. Aggregate by scenario: `sum(med)` ‚Üí total kg CO‚ÇÇ across days.  
3. Divide by CO‚ÇÇ per smartphone.  
4. Plot smartphones (units) by scenario and save `plots/smartphones_equivalent.png`.  

**Key Assumption / Constant**
- `co2_per_phone = 48 kg CO‚ÇÇ` per smartphone (manufacturing life-cycle assessment benchmark).

### 3) `marginalMetrics.R`
**Question:** How many cars emit the same level of CO‚ÇÇ in one year?  

**Goal:** Convert scenario totals into ‚Äúcars that could drive for one year with the same CO‚ÇÇ‚Äù.  

**Steps**
1. Read `outputs/marginal_per_vehicle_mc.csv`.  
2. Compute tonnes per car-year:  

   - Annual distance: **15,196 km/year** (Ireland private car, CSO 2025).  
   - Tailpipe intensity: **103 g CO‚ÇÇ/km** (EU new-car fleet, WLTP, ICCT Feb 2025).  

   \[
   t\_per\_car = \frac{103 \text{ g/km} \times 15,196 \text{ km}}{10^6} = 1.565 \text{ t CO‚ÇÇ/car-year}
   \]

3. Aggregate by scenario: `sum(per_vehicle_total_kg_med)` ‚Üí total kg CO‚ÇÇ.  
4. Convert to tonnes and divide by `t_per_car`.  
5. Plot number of cars (annual equivalent) and save `plots/cars_equivalent.png`.  

**Key Assumptions / Constants**
- **Annual km:** 15,196 km (CSO, 2025 transport snapshot).  
- **CO‚ÇÇ intensity:** 103 g/km (ICCT EU fleet update, Feb 2025).

## Reproducibility & Notes
- Ensure all three input CSVs exist in `outputs/` with the required columns.  
- All plots hide legends (one bar per scenario) and write to `plots/`.  
- If you change benchmarks (e.g., new CSO/ICCT figure), update constants at the top of each script and re-run.  
- Units are **kg CO‚ÇÇ** and the scripts handle conversions (kg ‚Üí tonnes, kg ‚Üí units) internally.
